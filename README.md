# StudentDataStorage

This is a little back-end project about student data storage where the technologies used are: Java, Hibernate and MySQL.
The Student class has a relationship one-to-one to Laptop class. And the class Clas has a relationship one-to-many to Student class. 
You can do different things like:
1. Display the list of students from a class using class name or class id.
2. Display for a particular student the ram memory and the processor of his laptop.
3. Display the list of laptops whose guarantee is greater than 1 year.
4. Find out if a list of guarantees has a specific laptop.
5. Display the color of a student's laptop using student's city and student's surname.
